      <h3><b>Maker Project</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <h6>Covered: Skills 1, 2, 3</h6>
      <p>The Individual Maker Project was a key pressing matter and drew upon, to varying degrees, all three target skills. With a goal of building a “cybernetic” baby monitor, and in order of skills, I would need:</p> 
      <ol>
        <li>Coding - writing a large library of bespoke Python, operating on a Raspberry Pi to support key objectives of environmental monitoring, cry detection and classification utilising a machine learning model, data logging and smart notifications, and a real-time video stream.</li>
        <li>Physical “making” - soldering sensors and mounting components.</li>
        <li>Project managing - setting a defined set of goals, working to an iterative model that aims to ensure a functional product at multiple intervals in line with hitting a strict demo-day deadline.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I found myself barrelling down ever more rabbit holes as I iterated from a simple BME280-based environmental sensor to a fully-featured prototype. To extract from CECS6001 Assessment 2B writings:</p>
      <i>
        <p>In the prototype phase, boundaries of the product will be strictly defined by the creator. In particular, the functions that sit outside these boundaries are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementation of only a single degree of machine-learning enabled monitoring (audio).</li>
          <li>No dedicated web interface (although camera feed was made available in a simple webform).</li>
          <li>No dedicated applications for direct mobile interfacing.</li>
          <li>No analysis of captured data or cross-referencing with health studies and outcomes.</li>
          <li>No “feedback” of captured data or data analysis into the models and processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further to this, the physical design of the prototype is limited as a bare Raspberry Pi with USB microphone, wired and bare environmental sensor, and ribbon-connected, unhoused, camera.  The lack of housing, and inability to suitably mount the sensors without utilising twisted wire, is far from marketable or usable in an average household scenario.</p>
      </i>
      <p>Please refer to the following page for a schematic of the Maker Project, covering ultimate goal and prototype implementation, and feel free to review the committed code at <a href="https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7446851/cecs_8001_s1_maker" target="_blank">https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7446851/cecs_8001_s1_maker</a>(please ask me for access as required, as I’m not comfortable with making it public in the present state).</p>

      <h5>Prototype Behaviour</h5>
      <p>As depicted in the schematic, the prototype employs three forms of sensor; a camera for video, microphone for audio and BME680 for environmental monitoring. Whilst the video sensor is simply, in the prototype, passed to a locally hosted webpage for direct viewing without any other action derivation, the audio and environmental monitors are utilised to continuously log data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cry detection (based on self-trained TensorFlow machine learning model), and, if detected:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Cry classification (discomfort, hunger, tired, burping)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Environmental variables (takes 20 readings, averages all metrics, then reports):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Temperature</li>
          <li>Humidity</li>
          <li>Pressure</li>
          <li>Gas (presence of compounds inferred from conductivity measure)</li>
          <li>Internal Air Quality (IAQ) (as derived from above data, by Bosch’s proprietary formula)</li>
          <li>IAQ accuracy (sensor calibrates on start-up, with accuracy slowly increasing to “3”)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>For broad interoperability, logging was directed:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Locally for later collection and internal use.</li>
        <li>Via MQTT for logging and monitoring on other devices on the internal network (screenshot from networked laptop), and integration with smart home services such as Home Assistant:</li>
