      <h3><b>Skills To Be Developed</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <h4>Skill 1: Coding</h4>
      <p>It makes sense to start this reflection piece with the most familiar, and yet the most tantalisingly unexplored, of the skillsets. As previously stated, I have had some previous experience with Python but have always wanted to take it further. As such, within this year I am hoping to expand my coding ability beyond just taking and manipulating csv files into building bespoke programs from scratch, with interactive elements and particularly with an ability to interact with online sources and APIs.</p> 
      <h4>Skill 2: Building</h4>
      <p>For the purposes of this course, I am considering building as covering both electrical circuit creation and physical, small scale, construction, and fabrication. Building of this from is a skill that I have dabbled with less than I have coding, and as such I will be growing up from a relatively basic foundation. The aims of my “building” skills growth through this course are, thus, to be able to understand, form and validate basic circuits containing sensors and feeding back data in suitable format, and construct bespoke physical solutions for utilisation in projects such as those in the course, and in home contexts for anything from car restoration to home automation. Cybernetic applications are to be of focus as that is after all the name of the degree!</p>
      <h4>Skill 3: Project (and Self) Management</h4>
      <p>Whilst I have managed a team, and the quality assurance aspect of deliverables, within my professional career, I have never particularly done well at (or put time into) the end-to-end big picture management of a project of any scale. As I progress in my career (and in personal life), this is a skillset that will be of incredible value, and it is one I can hone through the homework pieces and in particular the builder projects, where I will be responsible for defining scope, coordinating effort, managing deadlines and goals, and communicating with stakeholders (in this context, teaching staff and other students).</p>
