      <h4>Fortnight 1: A Tale of Two Chatbots/Intro2Python</h4>
      <h6>Covered: Skill 1</h6>
      <p>The introductory fortnight was instrumental in rebuilding confidence in my Python knowledge – The chatbot example was straightforward to understand as a concept and moreover it was instantly clear that even a simple program could be of value to the concepts being covered within the Master’s.</p> 
      <p>Once the coordinate system was understood, the fortnight’s homework was similarly motivating in that it gave confidence in both my existing basic ability, and my capacity to both extend this knowledge and assist others in their learning. I picked up the existing code and refactored it in a manner that made sense to me as a cohesive package with common libraries rather than four individual, self-contained modules. Further to this, I initiated a git repository to maintain my code through the course and reached out to classmates for their letter code with the goal of building a full “font” worth of letters (which worked, for nine letters at least!):</p>

      <h4>Fortnight 2: Purposeful Behaviour/Tic Tac Toe/Web Scraping</h4>
      <h6>Covered: Skill 1</h6>
      <p>The second fortnight gave opportunity for more complicated code. It was this step up in complexity that that I found a key learning - room for a more iterative approach to solving a given problem in a way that ensured that a viable product would be delivered with every step, and the value of improvements could be considered. This approach is, of course, fundamental to Agile delivery methodologies, but was not something I had considered deeply with respect to individual projects – it is something I will aim to bring with me on future works.</p> 
      <p>Within this fortnight came another opportunity for coding learning, outside of the homework – it was my group’s turn to present the Resource Facilitation in fortnight 3, and we elected to base a component of our presentation on <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Suzanne Treister’s HEXEN 2.0 Tarot deck</a>. To print the seventy-eight cards from the deck, the higher resolution variants from the site were necessary and these were only accessible through following the seventy-eight individual links, and manually saving the images one-by-one. With the Python homework in mind, and an awareness that this was exactly the sort of circumstance in which I should be trying to utilise a more efficient code-based solution. So, it was time to get to work.</p>
      <p>I managed to avoid reinventing the wheel by identifying suitable guides online and wrangling them together to fit the fact that it would need to crawl one level deeper than just the images on a single page:</p>

      </ul>
