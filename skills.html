      <h4>Skill 1: Coding</h4>
      <p>It makes sense to start this reflection piece with the most familiar, and yet the most tantalisingly unexplored, of the skillsets. As previously stated, I have had some previous experience with Python but have always wanted to take it further. As such, within this year I am hoping to expand my coding ability beyond just taking and manipulating csv files into building bespoke programs from scratch, with interactive elements and particularly with an ability to interact with online sources and APIs.</p> 
      <h5>Baseline:</h5>
      <p>Basic script writing in various languages over the years - <i>TI-Basic</i> on a TI83 graphics calculator in high school, brief dabblings in <i>FORTRAN</i>, <i>MATLAB</i>, and <i>GPSS/H</i> at University, and <i>VBA Script</i> and <i>Python</i> for rudimentary test automations in a professional space.</p>
      <p>Whilst this may superficially seem like a large amount of experience, at no point have I felt my self far enough into a coding language to gain proper understanding on syntax, algorithmic implementation and the challenges of increased complexity.</p>
      <h5>Goals:</h5>
      <p>I'm seeking to make use of the simplicity of Python, and the wealth of online knowledge available, to build more complex solutions that integrate different modules and communicate with existing services. Moreover I qwould like to achieve a degree of proficiency sufficient to implement machine learning within Python, find uses for it in simplifying tasks, and understand any files developed by others that I might find online.</p>
      <h5>Development plan:</h5>
      <p>At the start of the year I will complete a generic Udemy (or YouTube) course that introduces basic skills. Throughout the year I will strive to find aways to implement more complex, and <i>better</i> (in terms of best practice) solutions for uni-related, and where available, non-uni-related tasks. At each quarterly Build Journal checkpoint I will reflect on my progress towards the goals outlines above, and provide commentary.</p>

      <h4>Skill 2: Building</h4>
      <p>For the purposes of this course, I am considering building as covering both electrical circuit creation and physical, small scale, construction, and fabrication. Building of this from is a skill that I have dabbled with less than I have coding, and as such I will be growing up from a relatively basic foundation. </p>
      <h5>Baseline:</h5>
      <p>Way back in year 10 of high school (2004, for reference) there were units of the "Design Technology" subject that involved basic soldering and circuit making.It goes without saying that in the years between all but the most basic knowledge had slipped. I have maintained and developed the typical DIY homeowner skillset (building a couple of pergolas, repairing the roof, etc., etc.), but the only notable wiring I have done in this time is a rather average job of reinstalling an old car's loom. Suffice to say, my ability with electronic wiring, soldering, and small scale "building" is presently at a very low level!</p>
      <h5>Goals:</h5>
      <p>I aim to be able to understand, form, and validate basic circuits containing sensors and feeding back data in suitable format, and construct bespoke physical solutions for utilisation in projects such as those in the course, and in home contexts for anything from car restoration to home automation. Cybernetic applications are to be of focus as that is after all the name of the degree!</p>
      <h5>Development plan:</h5>
      <p>I will seek, troughout the year, opportunities for practical application of skills in the homework and in day-to-day life, in particular in parental activities. Within the bounds of the first semester I will target an ability to string together basic circuits on an adhoc basis, whether by wiring or breadboarding. By second semester's end I aim to have a degree of proficiency at soldering, an understanding of how basic electronic components function, and to be able to create from scratch a simple yet functional (viable for implementation) circuit to serve a practical purpose.</p>

      <h4>Skill 3: Project (and Self) Management</h4>
      <p>Whilst I have managed a team, and the quality assurance aspect of deliverables, within my professional career, I have never particularly done well at (or put time into) the end-to-end big picture management of a project of any scale. As I progress in my career (and in personal life), this is a skillset that will be of incredible value, and it is one I can hone through the homework pieces and in particular the builder projects, where I will be responsible for defining scope, coordinating effort, managing deadlines and goals, and communicating with a broader range of stakeholders.</p> 
      <h5>Baseline:</h5>
      <p>Experience leading technical aspects of software test execution, and of management of testing activities, stakeholder liaison, strategic planning and staff wellbeing/HR needs. Limited view of "big picture" view of project from initiation to scaling or past release to decomission.</p>
      <h5>Goals:</h5>
      <p>I aim to better understand the end-to-end of a project's lifecycle, and an ability to lead governing/managing discussions and activities with a Cybernetic, system-oriented way of thinking. </p>
      <h5>Development plan:</h5>
      <p>I will find myself  opportunities throughout, in particular, the second semester to build knowledge on high-level governance of projects. I will take the driving seat in management of group tasks and reflect on the activities that comprise them, even where they are not in line with traditional software/hardware developement. I will attempt to take a growingly Cybernetic mindset to these activities, that takes value from interdisciplinary thinkings. By the end of the second semester, I will have an appreciation of holistic project management and a view on future developmental needs.</p>
