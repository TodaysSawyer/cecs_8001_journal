      <h4>Fortnight 1: A Tale of Two Chatbots/Intro2Python</h4>
      <h6>Covered: Skill 1</h6>
      <p>The introductory fortnight was instrumental in rebuilding confidence in my Python knowledge – The chatbot example was straightforward to understand as a concept and moreover it was instantly clear that even a simple program could be of value to the concepts being covered within the Master’s.</p> 
      <p>Once the coordinate system was understood, the fortnight’s homework was similarly motivating in that it gave confidence in both my existing basic ability, and my capacity to both extend this knowledge and assist others in their learning. I picked up the existing code and refactored it in a manner that made sense to me as a cohesive package with common libraries rather than four individual, self-contained modules. Further to this, I initiated a git repository to maintain my code through the course and reached out to classmates for their letter code with the goal of building a full “font” worth of letters (which worked, for nine letters at least!):</p>

      <h4>Fortnight 2: Purposeful Behaviour/Tic Tac Toe/Web Scraping</h4>
      <h6>Covered: Skill 1</h6>
      <p>The second fortnight gave opportunity for more complicated code. It was this step up in complexity that that I found a key learning - room for a more iterative approach to solving a given problem in a way that ensured that a viable product would be delivered with every step, and the value of improvements could be considered. This approach is, of course, fundamental to Agile delivery methodologies, but was not something I had considered deeply with respect to individual projects – it is something I will aim to bring with me on future works.</p> 
      <p>Within this fortnight came another opportunity for coding learning, outside of the homework – it was my group’s turn to present the Resource Facilitation in fortnight 3, and we elected to base a component of our presentation on <a href="http://www.suzannetreister.net/HEXEN2/TAROT_COL/HEXEN_2_TAROT.html" target="_blank">Suzanne Treister’s HEXEN 2.0 Tarot deck</a>. To print the seventy-eight cards from the deck, the higher resolution variants from the site were necessary and these were only accessible through following the seventy-eight individual links, and manually saving the images one-by-one. With the Python homework in mind, and an awareness that this was exactly the sort of circumstance in which I should be trying to utilise a more efficient code-based solution. So, it was time to get to work.</p>
      <p>I managed to avoid reinventing the wheel by identifying suitable guides online and wrangling them together to fit the fact that it would need to crawl one level deeper than just the images on a single page:</p>

      <h4>Fortnight 3: Modelling, Simulation & Feedback Loops</h4>
      <h6>Covered: Skill 1, Skill 2 (somewhat)</h6>
      <p>Fortnight 3 presented a nice break from Python coding for assessment, but instead introduced the Arduino via Tinkercad, and notably the variant of C++ that Arduinos run on. With this being a language I had not seen since 2009 (at a guess), the challenge of understanding the problem presented was unfamiliar and it was a reminder that not every tool lives in the land of user-friendly Python. Whilst the problem as posed was easily addressed, it presented a question that is very much relevant to the maker project – when multiple tools are available, which should you choose? Similarly, the exploration of different modelling techniques wasn’t specifically a coding task, but it did bring an awareness that there are multiple solutions to any simulation problem, and different ways in which one can be a “better” fit for the purpose than another – as the course progresses, and when undertaking the maker project, this will become increasingly relevant.</p> 
      <p>I plan to spend the holiday break tinkering with an Arduino and a micro: bit to explore this further – Either way I want to come out of this year a better, more practical coder, and do I want that to be specifically within Python, or also covering C++, Java, or something else?</p>
      <hr>

      <h4>Holiday Period</h4>
      <h6>Covered: Skill 1, Skill 2 (somewhat)</h6>
      <p>Within the holiday period I spent significant time getting my head into the IoT space, building an understanding of Sensors and methods of data storage via an Arduino IoT explorer kit provided loaned by the School. Via a series of online tutorials (as below), I was able to explore on-device utilisation of C++ code to send data and triggering signals to cloud platforms. Within this time, I was also able to engage some degree of “building” when it came to connecting and mounting varying physical sensors.</p> 
      <img src="fortnights_fh_screenshot.jpg" alt="Holidays: IoT learnings" style="width:100%">
      <p>While I enjoyed the early explorations here, I very quickly resolved the question I had aske of myself within fortnight 3.. The exploration of coding languages outside of Python was of interest, but inefficient and in many ways distracting from the ultimate goals of achieving suitable proficiency to be able to understand how, algorithmically, various problems could be solved and solutions implemented and perhaps more crucially the limitations and considerations involved.</p>
      <p>This realisation allowed a pivot to Python implementations of similar learnings, utilising a micro:bit in place of the Arduino. The increased familiarity of the Python language allowed me to properly focus on the end goal and the ways in which data could be managed and online connections made, ultimately unlocking progress on the individual Maker Project.</p>

      <h4>Fortnight 4: Modelling, Simulation & Feedback Loops</h4>
      <h6>Covered: Skill 1, Skill 2</h6>
      <p>As we stepped to fortnight four, I found myself challenged as I took the basic learnings of half of the previous fortnight’s work and applied it to a more complex system with both sensing and actuation. I initially challenged myself to utilise a DC motor via a dedicated shield, iterated my way to this point, and very rapidly learnt a key lesson around not overstretching to an unnecessary goal when under time stress! The stepping back to a more basic solution, with the motor powered and controlled directly by the Circuit Playground Express, rather than via a shield, afforded me the time to satisfactorily complete the video component and achieved the same end result for demonstration purposes. The lesson here can be applied more broadly – Sensing and actuating components, in the real world, may be more complicated than they seem on the surface, and there is merit to researching and understanding in advance rather than wasting time on an uneconomic solution! The video format of submission was also a challenge in a new area – It had me developing new skills to record two videos and overlay/cut them to fit sufficient commentary within the narrow three-minute limitation:</p> 
      <img src="fortnights_f4_screenshot.jpg" alt="Fortnight 4: Modelling" style="width:100%">
      <p>A key component of this fortnight’s building of skills did amount, to some degree, to “building”. In order to properly form a functional “creature” that could house the Circuit Playground Express and also allow mounting of a servo and fan, I needed a degree of basic innovation. This ended up being a trial-and-error process utilising tools available within the lab and my own home, with an output of a Lego structure and blu-tac as a bonding agent! Whilst this was obviously rudimentary, a key lesson I took was the value in delivering a functional “Minimum Viable Product” solution not only for demonstration, but for iteration – The dimensions and structure implemented with Lego could readily be measured and drawn in CAD software to 3D print the next stage of prototyping (and this is an approach I will seek to utilise in the future).</p>

      <h4>Fortnight 5: Data and Networks</h4>
      <h6>Covered: N/A</h6>
      <p>Fortnight five focussed heavily on data modelling and visualisation from a course perspective, and whilst this was absolutely a new skill to me that I enjoyed toying with and look forward to exploring in the future, my time to properly delve in was limited and stood outside of my primary skill development goals for the year. Outside of the assigned CECS8001 homework, however, this fortnight was that within which I seriously kicked into the commencement of my Maker Project, as discussed later in this journal.</p> 
      <hr>

      <h4>Fortnight 6: Introduction to Machine Learning</h4>
      <h6>Covered: N/A</h6>
      <p>Unfortunately, as a result of prioritisation of family matters as of the time of writing, fortnight 6’s homework remains a sole outstanding assessment piece. I expect to see an expansion of machine learning understanding and skill from what has been picked up within the maker project, and to expand upon this ahead of the next submission point.</p>

        <h3><b>Fortnight By Fortnight - Semester Two</b></h3>
      </div>
  
      <div class="w3-container">
        <h4>Fortnight 1: ML Formulation, Validation, and Fairness</h4>
        <h6>Covered: Skill 1</h6>
        <p>Fortnight 1 of Semester 2 took us further into machine learning, and in particular to developing a practical understanding of machine learning validation, fairness, and potential biases. The Google tutorial utilised for this demonstration was outstanding, and I consider myself immensely better versed as a result of the piece.</p>
        <p>Within the context of my Semester 1 individual maker project, I toyed with the manual creation of a model trained via TensorFlow machine learning, however determined that the understanding required to suitably undergo such work, and the time to build that understanding, were outside of my present means; instead I pivoted to utilising Teachable Machine as a friendly web interface that delivered a suitable output for my purpose, whilst obscuring and abstracting away the underlying mechanisms and nuance inherent to training such a model. This is something I have dwelled on since, and the opportunity to pursue investigations in this manner further immediately spoke to me. </p>
        <p>Within the conducting of this fortnight’s stretch task, then, I’ve greatly enjoyed both sides of the homework; namely the technical coding explorable within the notebook, and the running discussion on Fairness that is implicitly relevant to any model of consequence.</p>
        <p>The expansion of technical skill is ongoing but still of value; whilst this notebook had all code in place in advance, I took steps to run through and properly understand as much as possible what it was doing in each line. Realistically this action has not left me in a place in which I could build such a model from memory, however I believe I could now effectively work alongside such a template and produce something explainable, tuneable, and suitable for a given task.</p>
        <img src="fortnights_s2_f1_colab.jpg" alt="Semester 2 Fortnight 1: Colab screenshot" style="width:100%">
        <p>Beyond the expansion of technical skill sits the understanding of risk inherent to trusting a “black box” such as Teachable Machine. This fortnight has spelled out well the trade-offs that are balanced when tuning a model, and the importance of understanding the decisions being made when determining the appropriate balance. In the context of the homework’s “1994 Census bureau database” set, such data may be utilised within numerous civic contexts including in affirmative employment actions, monitoring of worker burnout, and the setting/adjusting of wages. Within the context of my maker project’s imagined end state, these trade-offs might influence whether or not a parent is sent a notification that they should be concerned about a particular health condition; whether it is tuned towards avoiding false negatives or false positives could be of massive consequence to the health of a child, or the emotional wellbeing of parents. To inherently trust a model without understanding where these lines are being drawn, and the meanings and values of metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall, is incredibly problematic and this is a crucial learning to take forward.</p>
        <p>The fortnight also required <i>another</i> video recording. Having learned from my mistakes, I adhered to the time limit through careful trimming of any pauses and instances of "um" and "uh", as well as through accelerating by ~12%. Ugly but effective for this purpose!</p>

        <h4>Fortnight 2: Past, present and future of a CPS</h4>
        <h6>Covered: Skill 3</h6>
        <p>Unfortunately, as a result of prioritisation of family matters as of the time of writing, fortnight 2’s homework remains outstanding. I expect to see an expansion of machine learning understanding and skill from what has been picked up within the maker project, and to expand upon this ahead of the next submission point.</p>
        <p>The requesting of an extension for this piece of work, and prioritisation of other works to suitably ensure completion ahead of deadlines, perhaps speaks to a growing skill 3 ability, however!</p>
        <hr>

        <h4>Fortnight 2b: Build Journal Update!</h4>
        <h6>Covered: Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3</h6>
        <p>The very traditional Microsoft Word document form of my semester 1 build journal was functionally effective, but lacking in the creativity I was hoping to rediscover in myself over the year. Further to this, its creation in no way enhanced the skills I have been looking to develop. So, the only thing for it was to pivot!</p>
        <p>I decided that a practical but creative option, that would involve coding (learning basic html/css), "building" (configuring a Raspberry Pi with a method of hosting a website, and anything else that would be entailed), and "project management" (strategising the migration of the existing journal, and managing myself as a nominal "full stack developer"), would be to start again with a self-hosted website. Moreover, learnings from this may prove valuable when it came to the group maker project, and general knowledge for future roles.</p>
        <p>As such, time this fortnight was dedicated to researching and implementing a pi-hosted website. <a href="https://www.nginx.com" target="_blank">NGINX</a> was decided upon as a server, and a template on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp" target="_blank">w3.css</a> was determined to be a suitable starting point.</p>
        <img src="fortnights_s2_f2b_nginx.jpg" alt="Semester 2 Fortnight 2b: NGINX on Pi" style="width:100%">
        <p>Exploring the steps of iteratively building and validating a site page-by-page, through a Pi-based remote development and hosting environment (thanks VSCode server!), has been on immense benefit to my tech-awareness; it has long been a missing piece of the puzzle for me. Furthermore, as a communication method it is inherently far more flexible and navigable than a single, ever-expanding document, and this has opened my eyes to the way in which ideas can be better communicated through different media, even in an academic or journalistic context.</p>

        <h4>Fortnight 3: I like to hack it hack it</h4>
        <h6>Covered: Skill 1, Skill 3</h6>
        <p>This fortnight’s homework centred on two Encryption techniques of differing complexities; the classic “Caesar Cypher” and the simple but effective “XOR Cypher”.</p>
        <p>The homework was in many ways a return to a comfortable norm; it involved solving problems utilising Python (enhancing skill 1 largely through reinforcement of previous learnings), and even a little playing with Raspberry Pis, however the exploration of simple cyphers was both interesting and informative. It gave an insight into not only how information can be sent in a manner such that interception does not automatically mean the information is accessible by the interceptor, and also then context around means by which decryption or infiltration might in fact be possible.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest revelation to me here was more a managerial/cybernetic one that I would consider within skill 3; the weakest point of a "secure system" might not be the encryption. However strong a cypher is, the message might be prone to interception at either end if the sender and receiver devices aren’t themselves secured. In this instance, the vulnerability was having only one user account on the sending Raspberry Pi, and it of course having Superuser access. Whilst the file was “locked” so as not to be able to be read by a regular user, anyone with rudimentary Linux knowledge could access it by elevating privileges with a “sudo” command, or even use this to alter permissions entirely. Similarly, when at scale the vulnerability can as easily be at a human level as an endpoint technological vulnerability.</p>
        <p>With this in mind I was able to very easily alter the message in advance of most students accessing it, in a way that in no way was malicious or damaging to anyone's homework but that proved the viability of such an act independently of whatever cypher was in place.</p>
