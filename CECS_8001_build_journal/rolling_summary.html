      <h4>Check Point 1 – April 2022</h4>
      <p>As of the first “submission checkpoint” I would consider Skill 1 to be well on track in terms of progression, with coding ability (and confidence therein) growing thanks to the course and side investigations. Skill 2 is still in its earliest stages, but finally getting under way – As stated in “Fortnight 3: Modelling, Simulation & Feedback Loops”, this is something I will be seeking to put time into over the mid-semester holiday break. Skill 3 has not been explored in depth at this point, btu will become increasingly relevant as the build project progresses; I expect to make significant further comment here by the second check point. </p> 
      <p>My thinking and attitude to building and coding tasks have changed notably through the first quarter of the degree. My confidence in my ability has grown notably and, where challenges have arisen (such as the Tic Tac Toe algorithm), I have found suitable methods to make progress rather than throwing my hands in the air and calling it a day! Extending from this is a new tenancy to try and find iterative approaches to tasks, and an enjoyment in learning via assisting others where they are needing help.</p>
      <p>Taking a sky-high view of work so far, I am happy with my current trajectory and look forward to extending it. Weeks 3 and 4 built upon skills regained in weeks 1 and 2, and the third fortnight allowed early exploration of “building”.</p>

      <h4>Check Point 2 – June 2022</h4>
      <p>As of the second submission checkpoint, Skill 1, coding, is reaching a point at which I am considering it of lesser need of focus heading into semester two. Skill 2, making, has conversely received far less attention than anticipated and will be of key focus in future works. Skill 3 has similarly received little attention, although to some extent this is inherent to the lack of group-work within the course to date.</p> 
      <p>Another key matter for this checkpoint is around the format of this diary. I had full intention of reworking this from a straightforward paper to a web site, and in particular aimed to iterate this from a basic online service utilising Wordpress or the like, to a fully independent site I could host myself on either a Raspberry Pi or within a containerised environment; to me this would feed into both coding and building skill development. The arrival of our second child robbed me of a lot of free time, however I aim to have a proper go at this in semester 2 and look forward to learnings derived!</p>
