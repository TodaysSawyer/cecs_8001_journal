    <h3>Introduction and Context</h3>
    <p>Coding, tinkering, building. Three things that I have considered elusively within my skillset for a long time. The word “elusively” is, of course, doing some heavy lifting here – Whilst I have had an interest for a long time, putting time into building a skillset has been something I have thus far struggled to achieve. I built basic Python code, certainly, in a brief stint in Software Test Automation... But that was in a very defined, pre-existing framework; despite success in the role, I always felt an imposter pretending to code working alongside real developers. And rather than taking the knowledge building further, I found myself with another opportunity that did not involve such knowledge.</p>
    <p>Similarly, I have toyed with tinkering and building, but always with a low priority – the old car in the shed has been kinda-but-not-really running for months at this point, despite a big pile of parts that I dream of fitting to improve various aspects of its performance and driveability. I have built a small hotel’s worth of second-hand enterprise-level networking equipment into our house in Adelaide, but never quite got to the intended point of creating a distinct IoT network with suitable firewall rules to ensure traffic security for primary devices. Again, I have felt an imposter at “home labbing,” and tinkering, despite getting some substantial portion of the way there.</p>
    <p>All of this goes to say, of course, that when I opened the carpeted box at the start of the Master’s it gave me the same feeling of excitement and trepidation as projects have in the past in their instigation; these were tools I felt I had some vague knowledge of, and was longing to explore, but past anxieties tempered my optimism. On further thought, though, this was in fact a different environment. Not only was the time to build knowledge captured specifically within what I was doing, but there were others at various parts of the same journey as I, some of whom I would in fact have more pre-existing knowledge than. And this threw me back to year 12 physics, and the amount of knowledge that was built not just from the classes, but from a bunch of us talking through and helping each other understand during the break between double-lessons.</p>
    <p>And thus starts my reflection – As of the commencement of the course I had some knowledge in some relevant areas and was keen to expand this to a degree that gave not only functional purpose but also internal satisfaction. This “journal” will be broken down into the specific skills I am hoping to develop through the year and include my goals, progress, and any setbacks along the way.
